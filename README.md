## **üîç Target Questions Addressed**
### The dashboard provides answers to the following complex questions:
1. **How effectively is the call center resolving customer issues over time?**
   - By analyzing **Trends in Calls Answered and Resolved**, users can track resolution rates and identify periods of inefficiency.

2. **What proportion of calls remain unresolved, and how does this vary by topic, time, or agent?**
   - The **Calls Unresolved (%)** KPI combined with slicers allows users to identify patterns in unresolved calls across multiple dimensions.

3. **Which topics drive the highest call volumes, and how do resolution rates compare across these topics?**
   - The **Call Distribution by Topic** pie chart highlights call drivers and allows deeper exploration using slicers.

4. **What patterns can be observed in call handling performance based on time of day?**
   - The **Calls by Time Bin** visualization highlights peak call hours, enabling better staffing decisions.

5. **How does customer satisfaction correlate with call resolution, and what factors drive dissatisfaction?**
   - The **Satisfaction Ratings Bar Chart** provides insights into satisfaction levels, with slicers to drill down into dissatisfied calls by agent or topic.

6. **Which agents handle the highest call volumes, and how does their performance affect resolution rates?**
   - By filtering using the **Agent slicer**, users can pinpoint high-performing agents and identify areas for training or improvement.
